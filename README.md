# Ollama Deep Researcher

## Overview
The **Ollama Deep Researcher** project is an advanced research assistant that integrates **large language models** (LLMs) for deep research capabilities. It supports **document retrieval**, **question answering**, and **contextual information generation**, enabling researchers to work more efficiently.

## Features
- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant documents from local or cloud-based databases.
- **Advanced QA**: Generates answers to complex questions based on the context of documents and research papers.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable to integrate with specific document types or research domains.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Integrates context from prior conversations or research to improve accuracy.

## Technologies
- **Ollama**: A powerful framework for LLM-based deep research tasks.
- **Langchain**: For managing model workflows and orchestrating tasks.
- **Python Libraries**: `transformers`, `pytorch`, `faiss`, `streamlit` for the user interface.

## How It Works
1. **Document Ingestion**: Ingest your research documents into the system (supports PDFs, DOCX, etc.).
2. **Model Interaction**: The LLMs process these documents to generate answers or summaries.
3. **User Query**: Users can ask complex research questions, and the system will fetch and summarize relevant information.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ollama-deep-researcher.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up your LLM configuration and document ingestion paths.
4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
- Upload your research documents and interact with the system by asking questions.
- The system provides contextual answers, summaries, and insights based on your documents.
